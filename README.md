Wanna know more? Wanna know what functions exist?
Go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/sw1tchbl4d3-github/htbapi/wiki)

## How to use the API
You can:
* Install the library
* Just keep it in your working directory.

### Installing - Way 1:
* Clone this repository
* Do `pip3 install .` or `pip install .` whilst in the repo dir to install.

### Installing - Way 2:
* Do `pip3 install htbapi` or `pip install htbapi` to install.

## Usage:

You have 4 sub-libraries you can import.

`htbapi.core`, `htbapi.machines`, `htbapi.challenges` and `htbapi.social`

Always do `import htbapi.*`, `import htbapi.SUBMODULE`, or `from htbapi.SUBMODULE import FUNCTION`. 

`import htbapi` wont work.
